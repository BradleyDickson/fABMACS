There are params.in files for cylinder and sphere restraints. 

isob.gro and isob.cpt can be used to re-run simulations from the bound state.

OUTside.gro and OUTside.cpt can be used to re-run simulations from the unbound state.

The "Reference" file is also here.

The sphpoints and cylpoints files are also here.

The params.in file will be described when you patch.
